Now it is time to provision a VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) for Classic instance. Use the click-thru demonstration below to practice provisioning a VCF for Classic instance.

!!! Important "About the IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) environment"

    The steps that follow are specific to the provision process of VCF for Classic as of August 2024. 
    
    The steps can also be used in the IBM Cloud portal. Users can perform these steps in the ITZ environment that was reserved up until the last step to create the instance. If using the ITZ cloud account and the **Create** button is clicked, an error will occur. This is expected as users added to the IBM Cloud for the ITZ environment do **NOT** have permission to provision or modify existing resources. 

    **If the steps are performed in a different IBM Cloud account where the user has permission to create new resources, the account will be charged for any and all resources provisioned!**

Fields that require a text entry (e.g. service name) are pre-populated in the click-thru demonstration.

The provisioning process for the VCF for Classic instance begins. When all specified infrastructure components with the request configurations are available this process is fully automated. In these cases, provisioning of a VCF for Classic instance can take 12 hours or less. In cases where the infrastructure as specified isn't immediately available the process can take longer. When the instance created for this demonstration guide was provisioned, not all the infrastructure was available. In this case, the instance took over 48 hours to provision. A client's experience will vary.

The VCS for Classic automation performs a lot of steps. At a very high level, al the infrastructure is allocated to the user's IBM Cloud account, the required VMware software is installed on each host, networks are defined and configured both in IBM Cloud and within the VMware cluster, and any selected **Add-on services** are also deployed. 

During the provisioning process, the status of the instance will be updated in the IBM Cloud portal. In addition, depending on the user's notification preferences in the IBM Cloud portal, e-mails are sent as major steps in the automation are started and completed. Additionally, service tickets will be opened if there are delays in the notification. The user can observe and comment on the individual service tickets.

When all steps in the automation are complete and all systems are operational, the status of the instance will change to **Ready**. At this time, the VCF for Classic is ready for use. 

In the next chapter, learn about the management capabilities of a VCF for Classic instance.

Now it is time to provision a VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) for Classic instance. Use the click-thru demonstration below to practice provisioning a VCF for Classic instance.

!!! Important "About the IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) environment"

    The steps that follow are specific to the management capabilities for Classic as of August 2024. 
 
    The steps **CANNOT** be used in the ITZ environment that was reserved for this course. To save costs, the VCF for Classic instance was removed after the creation of the associated click through demonstrations. 

Fields that require a text entry (e.g. service name) are pre-populated in the click-thru demonstration.

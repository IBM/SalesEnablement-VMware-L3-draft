**VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) for Classic** (formerly known as VMware vCenter Server (VCS)) is a hosted private cloud that delivers the VMware vSphere stack as a service. The VMware environment is built on top of a minimum of three IBM Cloud bare metal servers, shared file-level storage or dedicated VMware vSAN storage, and it includes the automatic deployment and configuration of an easy to manage logical edge firewall that is powered by VMware NSX.

The entire environment can be provisioned in a matter of hours, and the elastic bare metal infrastructure can scale out the compute capacity rapidly when needed. IBM Cloud provides clients with full, native root access to the VMware ESXi hosts, NSX Manager, and the centralized platform for management, vCenter Server.

In the following chapters, you will:

- Explore the process of provisioning a **VCF for Classic** instance via the IBM Cloud portal.

- Explore using the IBM Cloud portal to manage a **VCF for Classic** instance.

Welcome to the **IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions - Level 3** course and demonstration guide! The goal is to provide IBMers and Business Partner sellers the knowledge and tools to demonstrate the **IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions** offerings.

This course is not intended to serve as an in-depth study of VMware-specific topics; rather the focus is on the *IBM Cloud* aspects of the offerings. Numerous links and pointers to more content around VMware-specific features are included in each of the modules of this course.

!!! tip "ACCREDITATION"
    
    To receive Level 3 accreditation, IBMers and Business Partners must demonstrate mastery of the skills that are learned throughout the various modules. 

**Business Partners** must pass an accreditation quiz upon completing the course. The quiz consists of multiple choice questions, with four possible responses (and only one correct answer) for each question. **Hint: keep the demonstration guide and the associated IBM Technology Zone (TechZone) environment active during the quiz.**

**IBM Sales and Tech Sales** must develop and record a Stand and Deliver presentation. This video is intended to simulate your delivery of a “live” demo in front of a client. IBMers have the flexibility to define a hypothetical client, the pain points that customer has, and the goals they aspire to achieve. The recording must be a demonstration and pitch the value of the IBM solution by using the environments and techniques of this lab.

Specific criteria that must be demonstrated as part of the Stand and Deliver recordings are provided within the documentation that accompanies the Level 3 course in Your Learning. Before continuing to the next module, read the guidance that follows. Your comprehension of the information outlined will save you time while completing the lab work. **Hint: keep the demonstration guide and the associated IBM Technology Zone (TechZone) environment active when creating the Stand and Deliver.**

## Using the demonstration guide

The Level 3 demonstration guide is organized into two chapters, covering the ```VMware Cloud Foundation as a Service single and multi-tenant``` and ```VMware Cloud Foundation for Classic``` offerings of the **IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions** portfolio. These chapters contain modules that provide an *Introduction* to the offering, steps to *Provision* a deployment, and explore how clients *Manage* their instances through the IBM Cloud portal and the respective VMware tools.

!!! warning "WARNING"
    The agile nature of cloud means that the interface and layout of the IBM Cloud Portal and the IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions offerings change regularly. Screenshots and videos that are captured within this documentation might not always reflect the current versions available from IBM Cloud.

In some images, the following styles of highlighting are used:

- **Solid highlight box**: This style of box highlights where to click, enter, or select an item.

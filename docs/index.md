Welcome to the **{{learningplan.name}}** course and demonstration guide! The goal is to provide IBM and Business Partner technical sellers the knowledge and tools to demonstrate the **{{offering.name}}}}** offerings.

This course is not intended to serve as an in-depth study of VMware-specific topics; rather the focus is on the *IBM Cloud* aspects of the offerings. Numerous links and pointers to more content around VMware-specific features are included in each of the modules of this course.

## Obtaining the {{badge.name}} badge
**Business Partner technical sellers** must pass a short quiz upon completing the course. The quiz consists of multiple choice questions, with four possible responses (and only one correct answer) for each question. **Hint: keep the demonstration guide open and the associated IBM Technology Zone (TechZone) environment active while taking the quiz.**

**IBM technical sellers** must develop and record a Stand and Deliver presentation. This video is intended to simulate your delivery of a “live” demo in front of a client. IBMers have the flexibility to define a hypothetical client, the pain points the client has, and the goals they aspire to achieve. The recording must be a demonstration that pitches the value of the IBM solution by using the environments and techniques described in this lab.

Specific criteria that must be demonstrated as part of the Stand and Deliver recordings are provided within the documentation that accompanies the Level 3 course in Your Learning. Before continuing to the next module, read the guidance that follows. Your comprehension of the information outlined will save you time while completing the lab work. **Hint: keep the demonstration guide and the associated IBM Technology Zone (TechZone) environment active when creating the Stand and Deliver.**

## Using the demonstration guide

The Level 3 demonstration guide is organized into two chapters, covering the **VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) as a Service** and **VCF for Classic** offerings of the **IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions** portfolio. These chapters contain modules that provide an *Introduction* to the offering, steps to *Provision* an instance, and explore how clients *Manage* their instances through the IBM Cloud portal and the respective VMware tools. The **VCF as a Service** module focuses on the **multitenant** offering and includes modules on operating an instance using VMware vCloud Director (VCD) and monitoring an instance with IBM Cloud Monitoring.

This **Demonstration Guide** uses a reactive browser-based interface. The Demonstration Guide table of contents may be displayed as highlighted in the green dashed box in this image:

!!! warning "WARNING"
    The agile nature of cloud means that the interface and layout of the IBM Cloud Portal and the IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions offerings can change regularly. Screenshots and videos that are captured within this documentation might not reflect the current versions available from IBM Cloud.

In some images, the following styles of highlighting are used:

- **Solid highlight box**: This style of box highlights where to click, enter, or select an item.

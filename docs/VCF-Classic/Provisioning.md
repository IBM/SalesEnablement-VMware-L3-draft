Use the click-through demonstration below to practice provisioning a VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) for Classic instance.

!!! Important "About the IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) environment"

    The steps that follow are specific to the provisioning process of VCF for Classic as of August 2024. 
    
    These steps can also be used in the IBM Cloud portal. Users can perform these steps to configure the instance in the reserved ITZ environment until the last step (click create). 
    
    If using the ITZ cloud account and the **Create** button is clicked, an error will occur. This is expected as users added to the IBM Cloud for the ITZ environment do **NOT** have permission to provision or modify existing resources. 

    **If the steps are performed in a different IBM Cloud account where the user has permission to create new resources, the account will be charged for any and all resources provisioned!**

At this point, the provisioning process for the VCF for Classic instance begins. If all specified infrastructure components with the requested configurations are available, this process is fully automated. In these cases, provisioning of a VCF for Classic instance can take 12 hours or less. In cases where the infrastructure as specified isn't immediately available, the process can take longer. When the instance created for this demonstration guide was provisioned, not all the infrastructure was available. In this case, the instance took over 48 hours to provision. A client's experience will vary.

The VCS for Classic automation performs hundreds of operations. At a  high level, all the infrastructure (compute and storage) is allocated to the user's IBM Cloud account, the required VMware software is installed on each host, networks are defined and configured both in IBM Cloud and within the VMware cluster, and any selected **Add-on services** are deployed. 

During the provisioning process, the status of the instance will be updated in the IBM Cloud portal. In addition, depending on the user's notification preferences in the IBM Cloud portal, e-mails are sent as major steps in the automation are started and completed. Additionally, service tickets will be opened if there are delays in the automation.

When all steps in the automation are complete and all systems are operational, the status of the instance will change to **Ready**. At this time, the VCF for Classic instance is ready for use.

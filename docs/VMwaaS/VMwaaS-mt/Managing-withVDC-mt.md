Managing the VDC is done with the VMware vCloud Director web console, which is accessible through the IBM Cloud portal. This aspect of management includes common VMware administrative tasks like:

    adding and deleting networks, firewalls, VPNs, and network address translation (NAT) rules

    adding and deleting virtual machines (VMs), virtual applications (vApps), and affinity rules

    managing storage policies and named disks

    and other virtual data center capabilities that are exposed through the vCloud Director web console

Both of these domains are explored in this demonstration guide. When demonstrating to clients, sellers are encouraged to focus on the "on the IBM Cloud" aspects of the solution.

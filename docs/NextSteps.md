This {{learningplan.name}} demonstrated several of the {{offering.name}} offerings available. Users learned the basics for provisioning and managing both VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) as a Service single tenant and multitenant and VMware Cloud Foundation for Classic. 

## More to learn

However, there is still more to learn about {{offering.name}}. Be sure to check out the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/vmware/compare_offerings" target="_blank">offering comparison page</a>.

Additionally, there is an architecture pattern for integration IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center Workload Protection with VMware vCenter Server (one of the VMware components for VCF for Classic). IBM Security and Compliance Center Workload Protection offers functions to protect Microsoft Windows and Linux virtual machines (VMs) that are hosted in VMware environments. These functions include compliance, vulnerability scanning, and threat detection.  To learn more, see the documentation <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-arch-pattern-sccwpp" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Earn the badge
Finally, remember to complete the {{learningplan.name}} learning plan to earn the {{badge.name}} badge.

**IBM Sales** and **IBM Technical Sales** must complete a Stand and Deliver exercise to validate their ability to demonstrate {{offering.name}} to potential clients. Refer to the evaluation checklist in the learning plan for the Stand and Deliver.

**Business Partners** (both sellers and technical sellers) must pass the {{learningplan.name}} quiz from learn.ibm.com. The Business Partner quiz verifies use of the demonstration environment and click-thru demonstrations, and not one's general knowledge of the offerings.

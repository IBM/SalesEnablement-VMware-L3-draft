!!! Important "About the IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) environment"

    Before your ITZ reservation, please be sure to remove any resources you provisioned in the ITZ environment!


This {{learningplan.name}} demonstrated several of the {{offering.name}} offerings available. However, there is still more to learn about {{offering.name}}. Be sure to check out the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/vmware/compare_offerings" target="_blank">offering comparison page</a>.

Additionally, there is an architecture pattern for integration IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center Workload Protection with VMware vCenter Server (one of the VMware components for VCF for Classic). IBM Security and Compliance Center Workload Protection offers functions to protect Microsoft Windows and Linux virtual machines (VMs) that are hosted in VMware environments. These functions include compliance, vulnerability scanning, and threat detection.  To learn more, see the documentation <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-arch-pattern-sccwpp" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Earn the badge
Finally, remember to complete the {{learningplan.name}} learning plan to earn the {{badge.name}} badge.

**IBMers** must complete a Stand and Deliver exercise to validate their ability to demonstrate {{offering.name}} to potential clients. Refer to the evaluation checklist in the learning plan for the Stand and Deliver.

**Business Partners** must pass the {{learningplan.name}} quiz located in the learn.ibm.com learning plan. The Business Partner quiz verifies use of the demonstration environment and click-through demonstrations, and not one's general knowledge of the offerings.

There are two aspects of managing a VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) as a Service (VMwaaS) multitenant instances. At a high level, these are the management of the "on IBM Cloud" aspects of a VCF as a Service instance and managing the virtual data center (VDC) with VMware vCloud Director (vCloud Director).

This chapter focuses on using the IBM Cloud portal to manage aspects of the Virtual Data Center (VDC) like:

- adding and deleting instances
- modifying the vCPU and RAM limits of the instance
- accessing the VMware vCloud Director web console
- accessing add-on services
- managing interconnectivity

!!! Important "About the IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) environment"

    The steps that follow are specific to the ITZ environment reserved as part of the {{learningplan.name}} learning plan. If you don't already have an active reservation, you can create one <a href="{{itz.environment}}" target="_blank">here</a>. Follow the directions specified in the "Reserve the environment" activity in the learning plan.

    Remember, in the ITZ environment you will **NOT** have permission to create, delete, or modify resources. You will be utilizing pre-provisioned and pre-configured resources that are shared by all users of the learning plan.

    The steps outlined go up to the point of creating, deleting, or modifying a resource and then instruct you to cancel the pending action. This approach is common for client demonstrations as some events take longer than you would want to wait during a live demonstration. Explain to the client what would occur if the action had been completed (for example, "the resource would then be deleted.").

    If an attempt is made to complete the action in the ITZ environment an error message would be shown like:

4. Click **VCF as a Service** in left menu.

    ![](_attachments/ip-vmware-VCFaaS-menu.png)

    Notice the 2 tabs: **Virtual data centers** and **Cloud Director sites**. For this demonstration, use only the **{{itz.VCFaaSmt.name}}** virtual data center (VDC)! As you are accessing the live IBM Cloud portal, the number of data centers you see may vary. The **{{itz.VCFaaSmt.name}}** VCD is part of the **IBM VCFaaS Multitenant - DAL** VMware Cloud Director (VDC) site. This site is managed by IBM and other tenants that selected the Dallas location. This chapter will only focus on the VDC and not the site.

5. Click **{{itz.VCFaaSmt.name}}**.

### VDC instance summary 
6. Examine the information shown on the VDC instance summary page.

    a. The vCPU and RAM limit shows the consumptions limits that were specified when the instance was provisioned.
    b. The pricing plan selected for the instance.
    c. The VDC site where the VCD is located.
    d. The location of the VCD.
    e. The VCD instance ID. This is required when accessing the instance through the IBM Cloud application programming interfaces (APIs) and command line interfaces (CLIs).
    f. The network edge type.
    g. The connections supported.
    h. The fast provisioning setting.
    i. The public IPs assigned to the VCD instance.

7. Click **Modify limit**.

    ![](_attachments/ip-vmware-VCFaaS-instanceModifyLimit.png)

8. Examine the **consumption limit** options.

    Recall that the vCPU and RAM charges for on-demand virtual data centers are based on the amount that is used for running workloads. To control cost, clients can use limits to restrict the maximum amount of vCPU and RAM usage in the virtual data center. Consumption limits can also be turned off.

    a. Toggle to enable or disable consumption limits.
    b. Increase or decrease the maximum number of vCPUs between 1 and 2000.
    c. Increase or decrease teh maximum amount of memory (RAM) between 1 gigabyte (GB) and 40,960 GB.

### VDC Add-on services
10. Click the **Add-on services** tab.

    ![](_attachments/ip-vmware-VCFaaS-instanceaddOnTabpng.png)

11. Examine the included **Add-on services** for the VDC instance.

    !!! Warning "Access to the **Add-on services** not provided in the ITZ environment"

        At this time, administrative access to the **Add-on services** for this instance is not provided. The IBM Cloud Identity Access Management (IAM) controls do not provide sufficient isolation control for these services in a shared environment like the one used by this learning plan.

        Several videos of how to use VMware Cloud Director Availability (VCDA) are included in the product documentation, including this one that illustrates <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmware-service?topic=vmware-service-vcda-migrating-cloudtocloud-vmaas" target="_blank">migration from the VCF as a Service multitenant instance to a VCF as a Service single-tenant instance</a>

    There are 2 **Add-on services** included in this VDC instance: 
    
    - **VMware Cloud Director Availability**

        VMware Cloud Director Availability (VCDA) delivers simple, secure, and cost effective migration and disaster recovery protection of workloads.

That concludes the overview of managing a VCF as a Service multitenant instance using the IBM Cloud portal. In later chapters, you will:

- explore accessing the VMware Cloud Director web console to create datacenter groups, networks, and virtual machines (VMs)
- explore the integration between a VCF as a Service multitenant instance and IBM Cloud monitoring

In the next chapter, using the IBM Cloud portal, briefly examine the VCF as a Service multitenant site where the VCF as a Service multitenant instance is running.

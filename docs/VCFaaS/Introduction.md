IBM Cloud for VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) as a Service provides the VMware Cloud Director platform as either a dedicated (single-tenant) or shared (multitenant) managed service. IBM performs the configuration, hosting, operations, and lifecycle management of the VMware by Broadcom software so clients can quickly deploy VMware-based cloud computing environments. Compute resources are available as either dedicated or multitenant hosts that use IBM Cloud bare metal servers. Dedicated single-tenant VMware sites provide extra isolation and support multiple host configuration options to support flexible workload requirements.

For an introduction to VCF as a Service, read the overview documentation found <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vmware-aas-overview" target="_blank">here</a>. 

VCF as a Service utilizes a shared responsibility model that includes IBM-managed infrastructure and IBM-managed VMware components and services up to the hypervisor. For details on the IBM and client responsibilities go <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vmaas-understand-responsib" target="_blank">here</a>. The division of responsibility should be explained to clients.

IBM Cloud for **VCF as a Service single-tenant** is the dedicated consumption model offered as part of IBM’s hosted VMware Cloud Director service. It allows clients to right-size their managed infrastructure with a wide range of host profiles and storage options to choose from. It is ideally suited for production applications and regulated workloads that require isolation.

IBM Cloud for **VCF as a Service multitenant** is the shared consumption model offered as part of IBM’s hosted VMware Cloud Director service. It allows clients to request VMware VMs on-demand with no up-front commitment (billed hourly) or take advantage of guaranteed capacity and discounted pricing with the Reserved billing option (billed monthly).

When designing your demonstration, here are a few things to consider:</p> <ul> <li>the client's business and industry</li> <li>the client's business challenges and needs</li> <li>the role of individuals in the audience (for example are they C-level executives, technical, or both)</li> <li>what VMware offerings will the client be most interested in (VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) for Classic, VCF as a Service multitenant, or VCF as a Service single-tenant)</li> <li>are there specific use cases the client is interested in</li> <li>how much time is alloted for the demonstration</li> <li>what questions do you anticipate the audience asking</li> <li>what challenges do you anticipate the audience presenting</li> </ul> <p>The more information and answer to these and other questions you have, the easier it will be to develop the story you want to demonstrate to the client. </p> <p>As an example, if the client is interested in a new disaster recovery solution for a small sub-set of their on-premise VMware workloads, you may want to demonstrate capabilities around VCF as a Service multitenant with reserved capacity. But for a client needing to vacate an data center with a large VMware footprint, VCF for Classic may be a better fit. </p> <p>And as mentioned, knowing the roles of the audience is important. You need to address the demonstrate at the right level of detail and the benefits of the solution that will best resonate with the audience's roles.</p> <p>Demonstrating infrastructure solutions is challenging. If the benefit you want to highlight is the ease of deploying complex environments, like VCF for Classic or maybe some deployable architecture in iBM Cloud, you must consider the time it takes to deploy the solution. In the case of VCF for Classic, it can take half a day more more. The best demonstration solution in these cases is using a \"baking show\" approach. In baking shows on television, the chef will walk through the steps to prepare a dish and then slide it in the oven. But instead of waiting 30-40 minute for it to cook, the chef pulls out one that is already fully baked to show the audience. This approach works well for demonstrating the ease of making a provisioning request for a Cloud based solution and then instead of waiting for the new infrastructure, you switch to an already provisioned instance. The click through demonstrations in this learning plan can be leveraged for this type of demonstration or the IBM Cloud Portal can be used up to the point of clicking create, and then switching to the already provisioned instance.</p> <p>The other challenge is focusing the demonstration on the value add of the solution running on IBM Cloud versus the value of the end product, in this case VMware. As you saw in the previous modules, once a VCF for Classic or VCF as a Service instance is provisioned there are management aspects that IBM Cloud provides that add a lot of value versus on-premises or hosted solutions. These are the benefits to focus on versus just demonstrating that you can create a VM in VMware vCloud Director (VCD). For a technical audience, you may still want to show that step, just to highlight the fact it is VCD as you know it and your skills and processes work just they same in IBM Cloud as they do with their on-premises deployments.</p> <p>Here are just a few high level demonstration flows you may want to consider:</p> <ul> <li>VCF for Classic</li> <li>Client's need:<ul> <li>Move to cloud</li> <li>Data center evacuation</li> </ul> </li> <li>Goals:<ul> <li>Ease of provisioning a complete VCF stack based on clients needs</li> <li>Ease of growing the deployment on demand</li> </ul> </li> <li>Benefits:<ul> <li>Rapid deployment</li> <li>Elasticity and cloud pricing model</li> <li>Preserve current VMware skills and processes</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Demonstration method and flow:</p> <ul> <li>Click through demonstrations to provision and then manage a VCF for Classic instance</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>VCF as a Service multitenant</p> </li> <li>Client's need:<ul> <li>Meet business growth demands</li> <li>No increase VMware administration headcount</li> <li>Reduce costs</li> </ul> </li> <li>Goals:<ul> <li>Ease of provisioning VCF as a Service instance</li> <li>Ease of controlling costs and consumption</li> <li>Minimal VMware admin requirements</li> </ul> </li> <li>Benefits:<ul> <li>Rapid deployment</li> <li>Ease of scale</li> <li>Ability to easily manage consumption limits</li> </ul> </li> <li>Demonstration method:<ul> <li>Baking show demonstration with pre-provisioned IBM Technology Zone environment</li> <li>Show information required to provision an VCF as a Service multitenant instance</li> <li>Show how to adjust consumption limits</li> <li>Access vCloud director and deploy a VM</li> <li>Utilize Veeam add-on service to easily protect data</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Mock client demonstrations of both to these are available in the IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions for Technical Sales Level 3 learning plan in YourLearning (for IBMers) and learn.ibm.com (for Business Partners). </p> <p>When preparing for a client demonstration, or for IBMers doing their stand and deliver recording, don't wait to the last minute. Make sure the IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) environment that you need is up and running and the reservation is not about to expire. If the demonstration is to be given virtually, make sure everything works with the e-meeting technology you are using (i.e. Webex, Zoom, and so on).</p> <p>Make sure you practice the demonstration flow. There is nothing more embarrassing than a demonstration that fails. Know the steps that you are going to take. Know what you will say. Plan on handling errors that might occur. If you are using the \"baking show\" approach, practice what you will say in the transition from canceling the creation of a resource to moving to a fully provisioned instance.

A virtualized application, or vApp, consists of one or more virtual machines (VMs). The vApp communicates over the Shared plan's network, making use of the Shared plan's resources, or starting services that the Shared plan supports. A single vApp can consist of one, or multiple VMs.</p> <ol> <li>Try creating a new virtual machine from scratch.

One of the advantages of the VMware Shared plan on IBM Cloud is the wealth of templates available out of the box with the offering. Select the From Template option.</p> </li> <li> <p>Disable the Power Off toggle, as we do not want to initialize the VM until making other configuration changes in a later step.</p> </li> <li> <p>We recommend selecting the <code>vm-centos8</code> template, which corresponds to the CentOS 8 (64-Bit) official release, for the purposes of this demonstration \u2014 although you are free to choose any of your liking. Continue scrolling down the page to reveal more configuration options.</p> </li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Storage for the VM is our next consideration. As described earlier in the Provisioning module, there are a variety of storage options available for virtual machines and virtual applications deployed within the VMware Shared environment.

The environment is managed from a single VMware vCenter Server. VMware vSphere resource pools provide isolation between management and client workloads. Resource pools must be properly configured as the compute capacity is shared between the management and compute workloads.</p> <p></p> <p>With the standard architecture model, the management workloads are running on a dedicated management domain and the client workloads are deployed in separate virtual infrastructure (VI) workload domains. Each VI workload domain is managed by a separate vCenter Server instance, which provides for scalability and allows for autonomous licensing and lifecycle management. In IBM Cloud, the VI workload domains can run only on the same IBM Cloud VPC availability zone in the same IBM Cloud multizone region.</p> <p></p> <p>Learn more about the VCF architectures here.</p> <ol> <li>Click the Standard architecture option.</li> <li>Click Click to Scroll.</li> </ol> <p>Before specifying the location for the deployment, be sure and explore each of the Deployment input fields.</p> <p></p> <ol> <li>Click the Geography pull-down.</li> </ol> <p>When this demonstration was created, VCF was available in the following locations:</p> <ul> <li>North America</li> <li>Dallas<ul> <li>Dallas 1 </li> <li>Dallas 2</li> <li>Dallas 3</li> </ul> </li> <li>Washington, DC<ul> <li>WDC 1</li> <li>WDC 2</li> </ul> </li> <li>Toronto<ul> <li>Toronto 2</li> <li>Toronto 3</li> </ul> </li> <li>Europe</li> <li>Frankfurt<ul> <li>Frankfurt 1</li> <li>Frankfurt 2</li> </ul> </li> <li>Madrid<ul> <li>Madrid 1</li> <li>Madrid 3</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Find the most current list of support locations here.</p> <ol> <li>Click Europe.</li> <li>Click Frankfurt.</li> <li>Click Frankfurt 1.</li> <li>Click Click to Scroll.</li> </ol> <p>Before proceeding, click the information icon  for each field in the Management domain input section.  </p> <p></p> <ol> <li>Click Click to Scroll.</li> </ol> <p>Application Virtual Networks (AVNs) and Management overlay networks define the prefixes to use on the NSX overlay on the management cluster using the management Tier 0 gateway.

Clusters can only have hosts with homogeneous profiles. While it is possible to create clusters that use different host profiles, it is not recommended. VDCs deployed to a PVDC can use all compute, memory, and storage within the PVDC, including when multiple clusters exist. To get consistent workload performance, it is best if all clusters within the same PVDC use the same host profile type. VMware Cloud Director automatically selects and adjusts the placement of workload VMs across the clusters in the PVDC. Placement is not controlled by users or administrators with VMware Cloud Director. All clusters are combined within a PVDC with no fine grain control for workload placement. </p> <p>A new PVDC is typically created for the following scenarios:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Separate and isolate different types of workloads. If different workloads are better suited for different host types, then separate PVDCs are required to ensure each workload runs on the correct host type.</p> </li> <li> <p>Run workloads in different data centers within the region. All clusters in the same PVDC must be in the same data center. Regional high availability across data centers is achieved by creating PVDCs in separate data centers, and then deploying the virtual data center (VDC) and applications into each region.

Clients must ensure that the remaining clusters have compatible storage performance layers of the deleted cluster. The remaining clusters must also have enough CPU and memory to contain the VMs of the deleted cluster.</p> <p>If not enough CPU, RAM, or equivalent storage for the cluster exists, the delete operation does not succeed.
